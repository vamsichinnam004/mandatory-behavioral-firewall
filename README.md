## Introduction

In today's fast-paced development environment, maintaining code quality is crucial. The **Mandatory Behavioral Firewall** serves as a proactive solution to prevent low-quality code from entering your projects. By requiring developers to conduct thorough research before making changes, this tool ensures that every modification is well-informed and beneficial.

The integration with the Rust/Bevy stack allows for seamless functionality in modern development workflows. Furthermore, with the support of Context7 and web search, developers can access relevant information quickly, making informed decisions easier.

## Features

- **Mandatory Research Protocols**: Enforces a structured approach to code modifications.
- **Integration with Cursor IDE**: Works directly within the Cursor IDE environment.
- **Rust/Bevy Optimization**: Tailored for developers using the Rust and Bevy frameworks.
- **Universal Support**: Leverages Context7 and web search for quick access to resources.
- **Quality Control**: Maintains high standards for code quality across projects.
